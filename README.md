## C++ Frozen String Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/FrozenString.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/FrozenString)

This library provides string which is constructible in both compile-time and runtime.
`std::string` is modifiable and not immutable but `frozen::string`
which this library provides is immutable and static.

This library is under construction.

### Constexpr

```cpp
#include "frozen/string.hpp"
#include <iostream>


// immutable!
auto s3 = frozen::make_string("poyo");
s3[0] = 'h'; // error!

// construct string
constexpr frozen::string<10> s1 = "hoge";
constexpr auto s2 = frozen::make_string("hoge");

// construct from numbers
constexpr auto answer = frozen::to_string(42); // from integer
constexpr auto pi = frozen::to_string(3.141592); // from floating point

// compare to string
s1 == frozen::make_string("hoge"); // true
s1 == "hoge?"; // false

// concat strings or numbers
s1 + frozen::make_string("poyo"); // "hogepoyo"
s1 + "poyo"; // "hogepoyo"
s1 + '!'; // "hoge!"
s1 + 42; // "hoge42"
s1 + 3.14; // "hoge3.14"
make_string("Today is ") + 8 + '/' + 5; // "Today is 8/5"

// output
std::cout << s1;

// conversion
s1.data(); // to char const *
s1.to_std_string(); // to std::string

// user defined literals
123.45_fstr; // "123.45"
42_fstr; // "12"
"hoge"_fstr; // "hoge"
u'ω'_fstr; // "ω"
```
